# Reconnaissance

This section covers the initial exploration of the application before testing for vulnerabilities.

## Note on Reconnaissance Scope
Since the target application was hosted locally,
traditional network reconnaissance such as subdomain enumeration or
extensive Nmap scanning was not applicable.

## What Was Done
- Browsed the application normally
- Identified available features and pages
- Observed where user input is allowed

## Features Identified
- Product browsing
- Product search
- User login and registration
- Shopping cart
- Feedback submission

## User Input Points
- Search bar
- Login email field
- Login password field
- Registration form inputs
- Feedback form text area


## Goal
To understand how the application works and where potential vulnerabilities may exist.

# Exploitation

This section documents the vulnerabilities found during testing and how they were confirmed.

## Focus Areas
- Testing input fields
- Checking authentication behavior
- Looking for basic security weaknesses


# Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Affected Feature
Product search functionality

## Payload Used
("><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the OWASP Juice Shop application
2. Enter the payload in the search bar   ("><img src =x onerror=alert(1)>)   
3. Submit the search request
4. Observe JavaScript execution via an alert popup

## Result
The application executes user-supplied JavaScript code in the browser.

## Impact
An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user’s browser,
which could be used to steal session data or perform actions on behalf of the user.

## Notes
Basic HTML input appears to be filtered, but the application is vulnerable
to filter bypass techniques.


## Goal
To safely verify vulnerabilities and understand their impact.

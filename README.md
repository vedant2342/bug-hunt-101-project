# Bug-Hunt-101-Project

This repository documents a beginner-level bug bounty workflow using the OWASP Juice Shop application. It includes environment setup, reconnaissance, exploitation evidence, screenshots, and a final report.

The goal of this project is to understand how vulnerabilities work and how tools like Burp Suite are used while testing in a safe lab environment.
